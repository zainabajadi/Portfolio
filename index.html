    <h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
    <p>As an aspiring Computer Information Systems student, I am aware of the impact of technology on our daily lives. With the advancement in technology, I am eager to learn and grow with technology for both my personal and professional gain. In addition to this,  I possess a fiery passion for Art, which is a valuable asset in pursuing innovation and creativity in technology. Technology's infinite digital resources provide an endless canvas for me to explore and express my artistic inclinations.</p>

            <p>As a valuable member of the BOC Network team, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, I leveraged my diverse skill set to drive the success of our programs. My responsibilities included managing the client database, conducting regular outreach via email and phone to ensure effective communication, and providing technical assistance to clients to troubleshoot any tech-related issues. In addition, I utilized my design expertise to create visually appealing flyers for special guests and upcoming events, and effectively marketed our events via email and Eventbrite.</p>

            <p>As a college student myself, I am acutely aware of the challenges students face in navigating the complexities of higher education. As part of my work with CUNY ASAP, I assumed a leadership role in administering a program that provided essential resources to students to support their timely graduation. This involved managing the program's database and conducting targeted outreach to students, as well as facilitating workshops and presentations to empower them with the necessary tools to succeed. I also played an active role in promoting the program by supporting events such as tablings and photo opportunities to attract new students, in addition to designing and disseminating flyers to effectively market our platform.</p>

            <p>During my summer break, I worked as a camp counselor at Kips Bay Club, where my passion for working with children was put to good use. In my role, I was responsible for supervising and managing a group of 12 children, along with my co-partner, and planning a range of engaging activities for them to participate in. Additionally, I ensured their safety and wellbeing throughout the program and on field trips outside the home base. I took a proactive approach to conflict resolution, helping the children navigate any interpersonal issues that arose, and provided emotional and physical support when necessary. My dedication to creating a happy, healthy, and fun environment for the children was unwavering.</p>

            <p>As a contributor to the international Nigerian Writers Database, SprinNG, I utilized my technical skills to create a platform for writers to network and inspire one another in their shared love of literature. In my role, I developed and executed a comprehensive social media strategy, designing and publishing monthly content on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. I also played an instrumental role in designing visually appealing flyers to effectively promote the platform. Despite being miles away from Nigeria, I remained an active collaborator and networked with peers across the globe, further expanding the reach and impact of the platform.</p>
